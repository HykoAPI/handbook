# How We Work

## Cycles

We have work in 3-week cycles at Hyko. This fixed cadence serves to give us an internal sense of urgency, works as a scope hammer to keep projects from ballooning, and provides a regular interval to decide what we’re working on.

The idea is not that everything we ever decide to work on has to take two weeks or can be completed in that time. But rather that we think about how we can break big projects into smaller ones that can be done in that amount of time, and that we bundle smaller things into a presentable scope of work that can be discussed.

We like to designate the work we take on with the scope in mind up front. We think of a small feature as a 1-weeker or a big feature as a 3-weeker. 

This designation helps us avoid a 1-weeker snowballing into a 3-weeker, just because people keep piling on more scope. Work is thus limited by a budget, and the budget focuses our discussion about what’s reasonable and what’s not. When a project starts slipping on its budget, the first approach should be to judo the problem and scope hammer the domain – and certainly not make it up by working more hours! Most things we work on at our current stage can fit within two weeks weeks.

## Cooldown

We don't do cooldowns while we're in getting-to-sustainability phase. We'll revisit this!

## Communication

Daily standup at 9am and the odd impromptu hangout! We keep Slack chatter to a minimum.

Kickoffs at the start of every cycle. This is where the plan for the coming three weeks is presented.

These mechanisms work together to free individuals to run their days with confidence and independence. We have 17 opportunities per year to make big decisions about what to work on, and the rest of the time should chiefly be spent carrying out those short-term plans. By having clear expectations for communication, it’s easier for everyone to build trust in where we’re going and why.

## Pitches

If you have an idea, throw it in Slack or add it to the Public Product Roadmap, whichever you think is most appropriate.

Naz evaluates pitches for inclusion in the next cycle. Before the start of every cycle, Naz’s kickoff will list the pitches that he's selected to work on.

## Asynchronously

Most of the work you do at Hyko shouldn’t require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone.

It’s far better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if you collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your main choice of action should be to note something down to raise at tomorrow's standup. That way we can sync up at a predictable time, rather than being interrupted in peak flow time. We try to keep Slack pings to a minimum as they're super distracting.

Don’t take that as gospel, though. Some times you really DO need to tightly collaborate with someone for an extended period of time, and that’s fine. We Slack for when nothing else will do (but most of the time something else will).


## No managers

We're currently two people, so we manage ourselves!

That means setting our own direction when one isn’t given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. Once onboarded, you should have the indepencence to spend your time well when left to your own devices. There’s always more work to be done, always more improvement to be had. 

## Balanced

We limit ourselves to a 40-hour work week. That's not a target. No-one needs to feel like they have to work until some arbitrary time out of obligation. If it's 3pm and you've had enough for the day, that's totally ok.

Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters. A healthy amount of sleep and a rich and rewarding life outside of work should not be squandered for a few more hours at work.

There are occasions where teams or individuals need to work off-hours for on-call, maintenance or emergencies. This time should not be in addition to your normal working hours. Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week.

We'll revisit the idea of a 30-hour work weeks in the summer when we're out of "getting Hyko to sustainability" mode.
