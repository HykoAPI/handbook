# Benefits & Perks

Since the majority of Hyko employees work in the UK, this section is written with that as the default. 

# Benefits

## Paid Time Off

Whenever you feel tired you can take a day off. At this stage in the company, things can be intense. Taking multiple days every month is totally fine.

There is no need to track your time off.

In addition to standard time-off, every *three* years employees are encouraged take a 30-day paid sabbatical. Just give a heads-up preferably three months in advance so we can coordinate the work-load accordingly.

## Personal Leave

We don't track sick days. If you're under the weather, take the time you need to feel better within reason. Hyko recognizes, too, that your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Consider taking a mental health day every now and again when you're feeling overwhelmed or mentally fatigued. If a day or two won't cut it, we'll work with you to find a way to reduce the burden of your work at Hyko on your overall mental health. We really do want your work at Hyko to be the best work you do in your life, and we appreciate that that's not possible if you're uncertain about your health.

Your outlets at Hyko if you're feeling your mental or physical health is taking a toll on your work? Talk to Naz!

## Summer Hours

Once Hyko becomes a sustainable business, we'll revisit the idea of 4-day work weeks in the summer

## Employee Profit Sharing

Hyko would like to share 10% of its annual company profits with employees, but it is too early in the life of the company to commit to that. We'll review in 2022.

## Employee Liquidity Pool

In the chance of Hyko being sold or being taken public, there are a few possible eventualities: 

If the founders are the only people at the company, shares will be evenly divided between them. Founders accrue their shares evenly month-by-month up to 4 years of tenure.

For the purposes of equity, both founders (Charlie and Naz) officially started at Hyko on 1st December 2020.

This arrangement does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the liquidity pool if you resign or are terminated from Hyko as a "bad leaver".
