# Benefits & Perks

Since the majority of Hyko employees work in the UK, this section is written with that as the default. 

# Benefits

## Paid Time Off

Whenever you feel tired you can take a day off. At this stage in the company, things can be intense. Taking multiple days every month is totally fine.

There is no need to track your time off.

In addition to standard time-off, every *three* years employees are encouraged take a 30-day paid sabbatical. Just give a heads-up preferably three months in advance so we can coordinate the work-load accordingly.

We don't track sick days. If you're under the weather, take the time you need to feel better within reason. Hyko recognizes, too, that your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Consider taking a mental health day every now and again when you're feeling overwhelmed or mentally fatigued. If a day or two won't cut it, we'll work with you to find a way to reduce the burden of your work at Hyko on your overall mental health. We really do want your work at Hyko to be the best work you do in your life, and we appreciate that that's not possible if you're uncertain about your health.

## Summer Hours

During summer, we work 4-day work weeks, aka "summer hours". Summer hours are in effect from May 1 through August 31 each year.  (An employee who has just been hired may have to complete a training program per their team lead to be eligible). Summer weeks are 4-day work weeks, so when a holiday occurs over summer, you can take the holiday off *or* your normal summer day off. Any additional days off would count as vacation days.

## Employee Profit Sharing

Hyko shares 10% of its annual company profits with employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure. Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous fiscal year, usually around March (e.g. 2020 profits distributed in March 2021). 

You're eligible to participate in profit sharing after two years of working at Basecamp. You'll accrue one share per month starting on your second anniversary at Hyko, and you'll max out your shares at 10 years. We calculate shares based on months of tenure so thereâ€™s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January. 

We ask that you think of any compensation from this program as not something to be counted upon, not something to be budgeted with, but as a true bonus. Year to year, profits and therefore the amount we're able to share with employees may swing wildly or not be paid out at all.

This Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the profit sharing program if you resign or are terminated from Hyko.

## Employee Liquidity Pool

In the slight chance of Hyko being sold or being taken public, there are a few possible eventualities: 

If the founders are the only people at the company, shares will be evenly divided between them.

Founders accrue their shares evenly month-by-month up to 4 years of tenure.

For the record, both founders joined Hyko on TODO: agree with Charlie.

This Program does not have any set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the liquidity pool if you resign or are terminated from Hyko as a "bad leaver".
