# Hyko Is You

Everyone working at Hyko represents Hyko. When a customer gets a response from Naz on Slack, Naz is Hyko. When a customer reads an incident report from Charlie, Charlie is Hyko. In those situations, all the other stuff we do to cultivate our best image is secondary. What’s right in front of someone in a time of need is what they’ll remember.

That’s what we mean when we say marketing is everyone’s responsibility, and that it pays to spend the time to recognize that. This means avoiding the [bullshit of outage language](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1528-the-bullshit-of-outage-language) and [bending our policies, not just lending your ears](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3513-when-empathy-becomes-insulting). It means taking the time to get the writing right and consider how you’d feel if you were on the other side of the interaction.

It also means that you’re strongly encouraged to help share your thoughts, experiences, and learnings on our blog. 

This goes for tools and techniques as much as it goes for prose. Hyko not only tries to out-teach the competition, but also out-share and out-collaborate. We try to contribute to open source. Extracting the common infrastructure that others could use as well is satisfying, important work, and we should continue to do that.

It’s also worth mentioning that joining Hyko can be all-consuming. We’ve seen it happen. You dig Hyko, so you feel pressure to contribute, maybe overwhelmingly so. The people who work here are some of the best and brightest in our industry, so the self-imposed burden to be exceptional is real. But here’s the thing: stop it. Settle in. We’re glad you love this job because we all do too, but at the end of the day it’s a job. Do your best work, collaborate with your team, write, read, learn, and then turn off your computer and play with your dog. We’ll all be better for it.
